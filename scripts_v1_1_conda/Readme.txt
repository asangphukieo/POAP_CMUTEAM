POAP tool is a bash shell script based pipeline which can be used to optimize 
ligands for docking using openbabel and also to perform virtual screening using 
Autodock Suite. It allows users to interactively choose options for performing 
ligand optimization for large sets of ligands. POAP uses GNU parallel to 
perform the fast and efficient way for the completion of jobs by optimally 
utilising multiple CPU threads, thereby reducing the time effectively. It also 
quarantines the ligands causing error during preparation, enabling seamless 
operability. POAP implements dynamic filehandling methods for efficient memory 
usage and data organization.

* Software Required to run POAP:
    + GNU Parallel (https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
    + Openbabel (version 2.4.0 or later) (http://openbabel.org/)
    + Autodock Vina (http://vina.scripps.edu/)
    + MGL Tools 1.5.6 or 1.5.7(for AutodockZn)(http://mgltools.scripps.edu/)
    + Autodock Tools 4.2.6 (http://autodock.scripps.edu/)
    + AutodockZn(http://autodock.scripps.edu/resources/autodockzn-forcefield)

* POAP Installation:
    + Just unzip and run the bash scripts provided directly to run the program. 
There is no installation required. 
Ensure the software required to run POAP are in place.

* File formats which can be used as input for ligand preparation:
    + MDL MOL format (mol, mdl, sdf, sd)
    + Sybyl Mol2 format (ml2, sy2, mol2)
    + SMILES format (smi)
    + Protein Data Bank format (pdb)

* Virtual Screening process:
    + Virtual screening using Autodock VINA
    + Multiple protein Virtual screening using Autodock VINA
    + Heuraristic VS with vina by stepwise exhaustiveness increament
    + Virtual screening using Autodock
    + Multiple protein Virtual screening using Autodock
    + Virtual screening using AutodockZn
    + Multiple protein Virtual screening using AutodockZn
